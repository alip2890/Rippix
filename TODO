* Port to GTK+-3. [ongoing]
  * One important issue is to use GtkDialog for messages.
* Do a rearrangement of the GUI. [ongoing]
* Clean up the code.
* Create documentation. [surely ongoing]
* Use dconf for configuration

In the following you will find the old TODO list from ripperX. I just leave them here, maybe there will be some time to implement it. Or just *borrow* it from ripperX ;)

---
These things are on the wishlist for 2.x releases of ripperX; they are
listed in some semblance of priority.

* Add the ability to submit CD data to the CDDB if the CD is not found.
* Eject cd when complete (option to spec cdrom?)
