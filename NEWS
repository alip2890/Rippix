This is new since 3.2:

 * The main window now looks nicer. Some minor appearance issues were changed.

This is new since 3.1:

 * The port to GTK+-3 was successfully. Rippix is now compilabe, though some
   issues remain. The status was changed from pre-alpha to alpha.

This is new since 3.0:

 * select_frame_handler.c is fully ported. This file handles the text entries
   and more in the main window of Rippix. All XPM files were abandoned, the
   stock images are now in use. The two radio buttons "Encode" and "Rip to Wav"
   were replaced by a Combobox. The Togglebutton with which the user can
   include/exclude a file for ripping/encoding is now directly beside the play
   button.

Following are the news from ripperX, copied from the now deleted CHANGES file.
==============================================================================

Version 2.7.3

2010-11-13
* Add Glacian translation.  Thank you to Miguel Bouzada.
* Add German translation.  Thank you to Chris Leick. (Debian #550207)
* Increase width of main menu slightly ("Go" button was being clipped).
* Automatically select all tracks after a CDDB lookup - by popular demand.
* Correct typos in error messages.  Thank you Chris Leick. (Debian #550208)
* Apply buffer overflow patches (LP #514739)
* Apply patch to no longer put underscore instead of space in id3 tag
  (LP #671852)
* distclean target removes .gmo translation build artifacts
* Apply patches from Robert Turnbull
  - Add year to Vorbis tags
  - Tags FLAC encoded files with metaflac

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.7.2 

Remove auto-generated files from SVN source tree.  You should be able to
build the package from the source tarball by running ./configure ; make.  
If that fails, make sure you have automake, libtool, and autoconf installed
and use ./autogen.sh.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.7.1 

2008-02-11
  - Italian translation added.

2008-02-01
  - Spanish translation added.

2008-01-27
* significant contributions from twb (at) users (dot) sourceforge (dot) net!

  - Revamp build system to use autoconf, automake, and libtool.
    autoconf >= 2.60 is needed, as well as recent automake and autoconf

  - Internationalization support has been added.
    gettext >= 0.15.x is required

  - GTK2 interface
    GTK2 >= 2.6.x is required
    Glib >= 2.6.x is required

    Not all deprecated GTK functions have been replaced yet. I've add the
    ./configure flag --disable-deprecated, as a dev helper. Currently, as
    there are still deprecated functions, a build will fail if this flag is
    used.

* fix gtk_start_pack_box assertion error messages.
* add ripperX.xpm icon file

2008-01-20/tm 
* apply child reaper fix from Paul Fox to correctly clean
  up plugin processes when running under dash.

* remove internal versions of id3.c and id3lib.c and use libid3 directly
  - migrate internal functions to misc_utils.c
* remove refererence to xpms.h
* add <string.h> to source files using str functions
* updated ./src/Makefile.in to link against libz (used by libid3)
* updated cdplay arguments
* replaced splay with play (typically part of the sox package)
* inverted the order of changes in this file

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.7.0 2006-04-16

* applied ID3v2 patches (provided by Ben Zonneveld - thanks!)
  - compilation now depends on id3lib

* changed how vorbiscomment is invoked for tagging OGG files; 
the OGG file no longer has to be copied during tagging

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.7 2005-11-06

* misc_utils.c: file_path_without_name() null-terminates returned string
  (fixes problem with playlists)

* select_frame_handler.c:  no longer auto-selects a track when it
receives cursor focus for editing.  This circumvents the call to 
put_track_title() which was causing the cursor to jump to the end
of the text buffer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2005-06-03

* err_dialog_handler.h:  added two new error errno codes for cdparanoia
* ripper_encoder_manipulation.c:  tweaked the cdparanoia processing code
  to work with Fedora Core 3 and to detect no disc as compared to no perms
  (unless -sv is being used); updated error messages related to cdparanoia

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.5 2005-06-01

* fixed ID3v1 problem with vorbis tags in OGG files where song titles are
  longer than 30 characters
* added basic m3u playlist support (unqualified filenames in target dir);
  the config dialog option is in "Files"
* modified df check in misc_utils.c to use -P (POSIX output), to ignore 
  stderr, and to tail only the last line returned

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.4 2004-11-21

* fixed awk field fetched from df in misc_utils.c  (SF #869947)
* added more bitrate options (32, 40, 48, 80, 224)
* added support for toolame encoder; note that toolame output files are
  given the .mp3 extension (even though they are technically MPEG layer
  2 files).  This is done purposefully to not confuse the issue for
  folks, as I think that most audio players out there today recognize
  MPEG layer 2 formatted files without issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.3 2004-10-24

* applied priority patch; allows the encoder nice priority to be set
  (SF #870373)

* applied AMD64 patches - thanks to Stefan Fuchs
  (SF #920105)

* hacked on cddb.c to try to address CDDB DTITLE entries without
  ' / ' between the artist and disc title 
  (this is an attempt to address SF #882144)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.2 2004-10-09

* fix put_track_title() in misc_utils.c to explicitly null-terminate
  the string after removing trailing spaces
  (thanks to Ken Wakasa and Clemens Gerlach for submitting patches)

* fix to real_local_file() in cddb.c to add the path separator when
  accessing local CDDB files (instead of querying them from a CDDB server)
  (thanks to Steve Bresson for the patch)

* fixed offset [ tracknum ] function definition problems in cddbp.c
  (SF #1030728)

* changed "Encode to mp3" to simply "Encode" (SF #963164)
  changed "Rip wav" to "Rip to WAV" as well

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.1 2004-01-04

tony mancill <tmancill@debian.org>

* Rick Coupland <rick@soloca.com> provided significant patches to the 
2.6.0 source tree, including:
	
	- Handle track artist data in freedb data & use it in ID3 tags.
	- Allow entry by user of track artists in the track name using 
		the same format as freedb (Artist / Title).
    - Config data is now saved when the OK button is clicked rather than
		waiting until the program exits.
	- The MP3 "File name format" config entry from the General tab is now 
		used as the default track name format.  The Wav "File name format"
		config entry is not used at all.  Actual file names are always 
		constructed using the "Filename format string" from the Files 
		configuration tab.

* functions in cddp.c now return -1 if they fail to read from the CDDB server
  (thanks to Erid de Castro Lopo <erikd@mega-nerd.com> for the bug report and 
  patch via the Debian BTS)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6 2003-09-20

Dave Cinege <dcinege@psychosis.com>

	* Upped version number to 2.6
	* Names now fully unix safe!

	*     Cddb names are converted before entry into the editting window
	*     Wrote high_ascii_to_low_ascii()
	*     Rewrote remove_non_unix_chars() (Renamed from remove_non_unix() )
	*     Rewrote convert_spaces() and convert_slashes()
	*     ASCII 160-255 now converted to printable lower ascii equivilents
	*     Unprintable/Evil chars are removed instead of replaced (shrinks str)
	*     Convert title/names only, user supplied path is not altered
	*     Arguments surrounded by single quotes, for shell safeness

	* rmdir wav work dir, if wav files are not kept && wav_dir != mp3_dir
	* Prettied up 'finished' window
	* Fixed disk space check (wrong position, awk $3 !$4)
	* Time Info in progress dialog made 275 wide to fit text
	* Ripping progress dialog made 130 wide to fit text
	* Fixed ripping progress (cdparanoia 9.8)
	* Now use glibc openpty(). Requires libutil.
	* Fixed cddb parsing of Artist / Album. UNFIXABLE BUG: Artist contains " / "

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.98

Scott Sams <sbsams@eos.ncsu.edu>
	*NOTE* You must delete your old .ripperXrc file before trying 
	this version! **
	
	-HTTP Proxy for CDDB
	-Configuration panels for mp3 encoders and cdparanoia
	-Added format string for cddb file names
	-Changed default refresh from 5 seconds to 1 second
	-Permissions on created files fixed
	-Changed default values in config_rw.c (must delete old .ripperXrc)
	-Fixed the hang if you clicked on CDDB button while offline
	-Track number now in double digit format, e.g. Track 02

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.97

Scott Sams <sbsams@eos.ncsu.edu>
	Made ripperX work with newer versions of cdparanoia. Improved the 
	parsing of cdparanoia -Q. Improved the reporting of cdparanoia's error 
	messages.  Fixed "Select All Tracks" button to have the correct 
	behavior.  Made SRPM and i386 RPMS of ripperX.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.96

Scott Sams <sbsams@eos.ncsu.edu>
	Greatly simplified the select_frame_handler interface. Instead of 
	having 2 tiny text boxes, there is one big textbox that will generate 
	names for both the wav and the mp3 file. Took out the play buttons for 
	playing the wav and mp3. I might put them back in, but I thought they 
	cluttered the interface too much (and I never used them anyway). Made 
	a radiobox for selecting the action (rip or encode).

	Wrote a plugin for the ISO encoder version 2 (the "encode" program). 
	The default encoder is now this one. It is free and produces very good 
	quality mp3s.

	All the plugins are now included in the plugins directory, instead of a
	separate package. They will be built and installed.

	Made a new logo for RipperX in the Gimp. :-)

	Fixed a bug for file names with spaces. The solution was to place 
	double quotes around the commands in the config dialog. e.g. 
	encode "%w" "%m"

	Allocated more space for buffers MAX_COMMAND_LENGTH, 
	MAX_FILE_NAME_LENGTH, MAX_FILE_PATH_LENGTH and MAX_TITLE_LENGTH.

	For the next version, I will make some SRPMS of ripperX, cdparanoia, 
	dcd and the ISO encoder.

	Incorporated patches from ripperX-0.9z and ripperX-0.9b-segfix2.diff and
	ripperX-0.9b-dk.diff. Added checkbutton for creating subdirectories.

	Made everything work with autoconf again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.95-devel1

Tejun <wineking@adam.kaist.ac.kr>
	Added support for plugin interface and cleaned up source code a little
	bit. Now ripperX deletes WAV file when a job is aborted.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9b

TeJun <wineking@adam.kaist.ac.kr>
	Changed the way CDDB displays its progress. Now it uses statusbar
	instead of separate progress window. Also the FIXME of V0.85a
	has been corrected. Changed the config read/write part such that
	it can handle older configuration files properly. Changed the way
	ripperX handles file names such that the names are kept after a
	ripping/encoding session.
	version number has been bumped up to 0.9b meaning it's a major
	release.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.85a

Scott Sams <sbsams@eos.ncsu.edu>
	Fixed a few segfault bugs and increased size of track titles buffer.
	Added error checking via error_handler dialog boxes. Added a progress
	bar.
	FIXME: Still does not update correctly in the beginning and while 
	connecting to server. Added Button for connecting to CDDB server.
	Added Notebook for configuring CDDB server and 2 new options -
	Convert Spaces to underscores, and Include artist name in file
	name. "Borrowed" CDDB icon from www.cddb.com and modified it using
	the Gimp.
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.84a

Scott Sams <sbsams@eos.ncsu.edu>
	Added Preliminary CDDB support. No error checking or configurability 
	yet. CDDB support is based on code from cccd, which IMHO had the
	nicest abstraction of the CDDB protocol from actual implementation.
	cccd was written by Sven Riedel<Sven.Riedel@heim8.tu-clausthal.de>
