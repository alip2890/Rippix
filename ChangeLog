	* main_window_handler.c (main_window_handler): Callbacks for the buttons in menubar are directly added and not via the buttons struct array. This solves the crash which was caused by a null pointer in the buttons array.

	* err_dialog_handler.c (err_handler): Usage of GtkMessageDialog. Error message from strerror and extra message are printed to the console for the time being.

2012-01-11  Aljosha Papsch  <papsch.al@googlemail.com>

	* select_frame_handler.c (select_frame_handler): rip_or_encode_combobox has now default entry displayed. track_play_pixmap was introduced to contain images for play_button[]. track_filename_entry has hexpand property set.

	* config_window_handler.c (cw_wav_handler, cw_mp3_handler): menu has now default entry displayed.

	* main_window_handler.c (main_window_handler): main_frame has no label anymore. main_window has new default size 600x400. The tool_item objects in buttons[] now have tooltips.

	* status_frame_handler.c: Ported to GTK+3. By today, Rippix is fully ported to GTK+ 3, but doesn't look very nice atm.
	(time_status_frame_handler): table was replaced with grid, making use of the newer GtkGrid instead of GtkTable.
	(wm_status_frame_handler): Usage of better names (could be enhanced)
	p_c_button is now pause_continue_button, vbox is l1_vbox, hbox was replaced with l2_hbox_rip, l2_hbox_encode and l2_hbox_total for clarifying reasons. pause_label was replaced with pause to be able to use stock buttons.
	Under section WMS_P_C_BUTTON_ACT: pause is used to determine pause/continue state. pause_continue_button now gets a new stock label instead of destroying and allocating continue_label/pause_label.

	* select_frame_handler.c: Completed port to GTK+3. GtkGrid and GtkComboBoxText are now in use instead of GtkTable and GtkRadioButton's. Variables now have clearer names (hopefully ;).

	* main_window_handler.c (main_window_handler): Completed port to GTK+ 3. Added stock_button property to struct buttons. Code under case WIDGET_CREATE was completely rewritten, now the menu bar is not composed of GtkButtons in a GtkBox anymore, but GtkMenuToolButtons are added to a GtkToolbar.
