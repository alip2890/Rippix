Introduction

  Rippix is a graphical interface to CD rippers and MP3/OGG/FLAC encoders.
  It uses GTK+-3 for the GUI, GNU gettext for internationalization and
  certain other libraries such as cdparanoia.

  Development is done on Savannah. You'll find everything you need there,
  including the newest source code:

  https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/rippix/

  Since version 3.4 Rippix should do it's job without crashing.
  Nevertheless it will retain Alpha status for some time being. Feel free
  to test and report bugs! See the Contribute section if you want to jump on.

  Rippix was forked from ripperX on 2011-12-27 using the 2.7.3 release.
  Depending on how ripperX will evolve, Rippix might borrow code in future.
  Because ripperX is a good ground to build up from, I'd like to
  thank the original authors for providing the application as free software:

  Tony Mancill <tmancill@users.sourceforge.net>
  Dave Cinege <dcinege@psychosis.com>
  jos.dehaes@bigfoot.com

  The fork was done because it occured to me that ripperX might be a nice
  application, being fast and easy to use, but in the meantime using
  deprecated techniques and presenting the user with a rather stale GUI.
  Also documentation is rare.
  Rippix tries to fill this gap. The first result is a ongoing port to GTK+-3.
  During hacking on the code it came clear to me, that I could go further
  and introduce the fork. Here we are.

  Version numbering was modified slightly and is now done in the preferred GNU way.
  A version is now represented in the format MAJOR.MINOR, starting from 3.0,
  Also, the package now conforms more tightly to the GNU Coding Standards.

Supported Platforms

  Thanks to GNU Autotools, Rippix should run on a variety of platforms.
  The range could be limited by the dependencies, listed as follows:
  * GTK+-3
  * GLib
  * gettext (currently only external backend applicable)
  * cdparanoia
  * id3
